# Technical test Arcane

**Heroku link : https://technical-test-arcane.herokuapp.com**


The Arcane Real Estate platform allows users to easily see different properties and their owners in cities.
Landlords can modify and delete their own properties.


To use, please create an account using the Signup menu. You can then login in the Login page, and add, modify and delete
properties in the home page.


I made this technical test for Arcane in December 2019, using Python and Flask.
