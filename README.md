# Technical test Arcane

**Heroku link : https://technical-test-arcane.herokuapp.com**


The Arcane Real Estate platform allows users to easily see different properties and their owners in cities.
Owners can modify and delete them.

A technical test I made for Arcane in December 2019, using Python and Flask.
